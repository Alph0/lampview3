<h1>Function Generator Blocks</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<h3>A series of blocks which act as various parts of a speaker circuit, with 2 function blocks [square, sawtooth], 2 connector blocks, 1 battery block, 1 opamp block, and, 1 speaker output block.</h3>
<h2>Goal:</h2>
<h3>To help people of all ages understand basic circuit componants and how they affect a wave function.</h3>
<h2>Concept:</h2>
<h3>This picture shows the rough 1st draft as a pitch to our instructors:</h3>

<p>[We decided to scrap the sine wave generator]</h3>
<h3>This next image shows the resulting wave after the square wave generator and opamp blocks are put together:</h3>

<h3>The opamp block is a simple opamp but with a voltage divider on the reference terminal, allowing the output to cycle between the - max voltage and the + max voltage.</h3>

<h3>The changes in the wave function can be heard with the speaker, encouraging the user to expirement to get the new sounds.</h3>
<h3>Anyway,</h3>
<h3>The terminal for the opamp's contacts is designed to fit in either the connector block output or the output of a function generator.</h3>
<h3>On the terminal there is 3 contacts, signal, reference, and ground.</h3>
<p>[The plan is just to use copper tape with wires soldered to 3 different contacts, one on the top, left, and right sides.]</h3>
<h3>Regarding the function generator, for at least the square wave and sawtooth wave we are going to use a simple 555 timer clock.</h3>

<h3>In this circuit, the amplitude of the wave can be transformed with potentiometer B, and the frequency of the wave function can be changed with potentiometer A, otherwise this is a stock 555 timer clock.</h3>
<h3>Sweet,</h3>
<h3>So what is the point of the connector blocks?</h1>
<h3>The point of the connector blocks is so people so can expirement with complicated wave transformations and make their own custom sounds.</h1>
<h3>In this circuit we mimic 2 waves added up in parallel with differing frequencies,</h1>

<h2>Progress Made:</h2>
<h3>Due to problems with our 3D printer, our first box, the square wave generator, has been delayed.</h1>
<h3>But we do have the STL file for the square wave generator box.</h1>
