<h1>Mike Trike</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<h3>An electric powered tricycle.</h3>
<h2>Goal:</h2>
<h3>To utilize our newly scrapped Power Wheels cars and practice small scale prototyping.</h3>
<h2>Prototype:</h2>
<h3>Prior to the creation of Mike, our instructor had us create a prototype for mike.</h3>
<h3>From the beginning, we knew our design would be like a regular rear-wheel drive car, but instead of 2 front wheels controlled with a wheel, there would be one wheel attached to handlebars.</h3>

<h3>We made it a goal for ourselves to use no outside materials, only the things we had in shop, this made the project significantly more difficult.</h3>
<h3>For our prototype, we had an old VEX cortex brain lying around along with Search & Rescue robotics kits.</h3>

<h3>A problem we enountered with the VEX cortex brain is that it communicated with it's motors by sending low amperage signals to drivers in the special VEX motors [which we were not using] that control a fixed voltage which actually powers the motor.</h3>
<h3>Since these signals were only meant to drive the motor and not to power a motor, our solution was to utilize low power relays that act as the drivers in a VEX motor.</h3>

<h3>To allow for both forward and backward we used 2 of these relays attached to the back motors.</h3>
<h3>For the front motor, we used a 180 degree servo motor, to drive it we just attached it to a servo driver that came with the fragments of the cortex kit we had lying about. [<a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/cortex">Cortex</a>]</h3>
<h3>The wheel for the front shaft was taken out of the Search & Recue kits we had as well. [<a href="https://www.pitsco.com/products/robotics-urban-search-and-rescue-challenge-set-with-6-channel-remote-control">Search & Rescue</a>]</h3>
<h3>Regarding control, we used a VEX cortex controller, we programmed the cortex setup with RobotC. [<a href="https://www.robotc.net/">RobotC</a>]</h3>
<h3>The complete circuit looked like this,</h3>

<h2>Final Design:</h2>
<h3>The final design of mike was quite easy in comparison to the prototype, with no digital signals or programming.</h3>

<h3>This is our final design.</h3>
<h3>One of our instructor's friends lended us some old broken powerwheels which we used for the back wheels.</h3>
<h3>For our front wheel, we scrapped an old childrens moped we found and attached it to some PVC and coupled it to the board with some plywood cut into circles.</h3>
<h3>Other than that the design is extremely straight forwards, we had a pressure switch we found which we used as a pedal to control the back wheels.</h3>
<h3>For power we had 2 lead-acid batteries wired in series with a switch to select between 1 or 2 batteries going to the back motor.</h3>
<h3>And we had a fancy key operated switch which we were using to operate the direction of the back motors and to act as a general on/off switch.</h3>
<h3>All in all, our circuit looked like this,</h3>

<p>[the speed selector switch is supposed to be a SPDT switch]</p>
<h3>This project took a few months and it was really fun to do, scrapping things and turning them into new stuff is really exciting and we learned a lot.</h3>
