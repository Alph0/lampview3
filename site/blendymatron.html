<h2>Description:</h2>
<h3>A blender.</h3>
<h2>Goal:</h2>
<h3>Make a blender so we can enjoy delicacies.</h3>
<h2>Concept:</h2>
<h3>Using a motor for a small submarine we found, we could make a blender.</h3>
<h3>At this point, we had basically no experience so we were limited in our tools.</h3>
<h3>Here was our final design:</h3>

<h2>Parts:</h2>
<h3>This project was not really thought out prior to construction, so we made it all on the fly.</h3>
<h3>Our case was a RingPop container, which was shockingly the strongest part of the machine.</h3>
<h3>The cutter was a random metal part we found in the rafters upstairs, which we took home and sharpened. Being basically 3 circles, we could only make it so sharp, so the cutter more beats instead of cuts.</h3>
<h3>For safety purposes, we always put up a big acrylic window wall thing and we have electric contacts to make sure the lid is closed before the user turns on the Blendymatron.</h3>
